- Current inefficiencies or challenges  

---

### 2. Feasibility of Execution ⚙️  
- Can a prototype be realistically built within hackathon timelines?  
- Technical requirements (APIs, datasets, hardware, integrations)  
- Possible blockers (data access, regulations, scalability)  
- What MVP (minimum viable product) can be delivered?  

---

### 3. Impact & Relevance 🌍  
- Who benefits (citizens, govt, industry, students, etc.)  
- Real-world impact (economic, social, environmental)  
- Can it scale beyond a hackathon? (enterprise/state/national level)  
- Why would evaluators care about this problem?  

---

### 4. Innovation & Competitive Landscape 💡  
- Existing products/solutions in this space  
- Their limitations  
- Provide a **competitor analysis table** (apps, platforms, research papers)  
- What innovative approaches/features can be added?  
- How can the solution stand out (AI/ML, Blockchain, AR/VR, IoT, UX, etc.)?  

---

### 5. Clarity of the Problem Statement 🧩  
- Clear deliverables expected  
- Areas where teams may misinterpret the PS  
- How to frame the solution clearly for evaluators  

---

### 6. Evaluator’s Perspective 🎯  
- How judges will assess this PS  
- Key scoring criteria (novelty, feasibility, sustainability, impact, completeness)  
- Red flags evaluators might notice  

---

### 7. Team Strategy & Execution Plan 👥  
- Essential skill sets (backend, frontend, AI/ML, hardware, design, pitching)  
- Ideal team ratio  
- Step-by-step roadmap (research → ideation → prototype → presentation)  

---

### 8. Flow Diagram (Miro-Ready) 🗺️  
- Provide a **flow diagram outline** in text format that can be recreated in **Miro**.  
- Represent processes, decisions, inputs, and outputs using standard flowchart notation.  
- Example format:  


- Mark decisions as diamonds (◇), processes as rectangles (▭), inputs/outputs as parallelograms, and flows as arrows (→).  
- Ensure it is easy to copy into **Miro** and convert into shapes.  

---

## 📊 Output Requirements  

- Use **headings + emojis**  
- Add **tables/boxes** for comparisons  
- Highlight **key takeaways**  
- Include **links/references** to real apps, platforms, or papers  
- Provide a **Miro-friendly flow diagram** outline  

---

✨ The final output should be **pitch-deck friendly** and directly usable for **team brainstorming + evaluator presentation**.
